    <strong><h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 70px;">Solar Panels</h1></strong>
    
<P>
In simple language a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel">Solar Panel</a>
is designed to absorb the sun's rays as a source of energy for generating electricity or heating.
</P>
<p>
  Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a
  range of technologies such as solar power to generate electricity, solar thermal
  energy including solar water heating, and solar architecture.
  We all know that solar photovoltaic (PV) panels transform sunlight into useable electricity, but few people know the actual science behind the process. This week on the blog we are going to get into the nitty-gritty science behind solar. It can seem complicated, but it all boils down to the photovoltaic effect; the ability of matter to emit electrons when bathed in light.

			<h2>Solar Panesl in Ghana</h2>
 				<hr />
         Ghana, like many other countries, is endowed with significant solar energy potential due to its location near the equator, receiving ample sunlight throughout the year.
         Ghana receives an average daily solar irradiance ranging from about 4 to 6 kWh per square meter, which is comparable to the levels experienced in regions where solar power has been extensively harnessed for energy generation.
         Utilizing solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, Ghana can effectively harness this abundant solar resource to generate electricity. The scalability of solar power offers immense potential for the country, allowing for rapid capacity addition with relatively short lead times.
         Moreover, the decentralized nature of solar power generation allows for off-grid applications, particularly advantageous for rural electrification initiatives. It can address energy needs in both rural and urban areas, offering a sustainable solution for power, heating, and cooling requirements.
         Solar energy also contributes significantly to energy security, as it is a renewable resource abundantly available in Ghana. From an energy security perspective, solar power stands out as one of the most secure sources.
         Theoretically, even a fraction of the total incident solar energy, if effectively captured and utilized, could potentially meet a substantial portion of Ghana's power requirements, contributing to the country's energy independence and sustainability goals.

			<h2>Policies and Schemes regarding Solar Panels</h2></i>
 				<p>
          Ghana has been actively working on policies and initiatives to promote the adoption of solar energy within the country.Ghana government established the Renewable Energy Master Plan, outlining strategies and targets for the development of renewable energy sources, including solar energy. This plan sets specific goals for solar energy capacity and implementation over the coming years.

    <h3>How Solar Energy Can Coincide With Crop and Animal Agriculture?</h3>
		Solar panels, while taking up space, can actually be installed in a manner that benefits agricultural activities. Research has shown that crops can thrive and animals can graze beneath elevated solar panels. This dual land use strategy allows for both solar energy generation and agricultural production on the same land.
    This approach, known as agrivoltaics, offers several advantages. Firstly, it maximizes land productivity by effectively utilizing space for both solar energy generation and agricultural activities. Farmers can continue their traditional farming practices while also generating clean energy.
  </div>

  <div class="col" style="border-style: solid;">
    <h3>The Beginnings of Agrivoltaics</h3>
		The University of Massachusetts Crop Research and Education Center has been researching the
 		compatibility of agriculture with solar energy generation, also known as agrivoltaics, since 2008.
 		In 2010, construction company owner Dave Marley partnered with researchers from the university to
 		put 70 solar panels in place, elevated seven feet above farmland, with zero disruption to the soil.
		Installers left enough space between the solar panels to allow sunlight to reach the plants below.
		The solar panels remain, as both the agricultural and solar farmers have benefited from the dual-use solar installations

  <div class="col" style="border-style: solid;">
    <h3>Benefits of Agrivoltaics</h3>
			Both landowners and solar developers have benefited from dual-use solar installations.
			For landowners, the solar panels provide self-generated energy, which decreases the cost of utility bills.
			The panels also block the wind and limit soil erosion to maintain soil health.
			Solar developers don’t have to spend as much time preparing the land for installation,
			as most agriculture farms are already on level ground. Solar energy production increases
 			because of the cooler temperatures in farmland locations, limiting the panels’ overheating.
  </div>

<h3>Crops Yield Beneath Solar Panels</h3>
		Despite less sunlight reaching the crops beneath the solar installations, the crops still yield.
 		Foraging plants, like grasses, generated about 90% compared to the crops not covered by solar panels.
		The University of Massachusetts has also grown other plants besides grazing grasses,
 		such as peppers, tomatoes, beans and cilantro. When placing the solar panels with three- to four-foot gaps between them,
 		the vegetable plants produced almost the same amount as those not beneath the panels.
		Usually, turf or gravel is the foundation lying beneath solar installations,
		but growing plants creates a safe, friendly environment for pollinators.
		Other researchers in Minnesota have grown native plants under solar panels to encourage pollination.
		The pollinators can then do their job and pollinate crops. Without pollination, crops can’t grow, and the economy collapses.
		Although crop yields do not match the gains from full, open sunlight, the costs even out.
		The solar panels provide energy for farmers, which reduces production costs.
		Large farm equipment can’t harvest crops grown under solar installations.
		Therefore, farmers must primarily harvest vegetables manually, so there are some limitations to what they can plant.

<h3>Solar Energy in Agriculture</h3>
Solar energy can coincide with crop and animal agriculture.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has continued to fund other research efforts in states across the country.
 With continued research and application, the future of solar energy in agriculture
 looks rewarding for energy conservators and farmers alike.
 A growing number of farms and agricultural businesses are looking to solar to power their daily operations. Thanks in part to the Solar Energy Technologies Office's investments, the cost of going solar has declined, enabling more installations across the country. Consider these questions to help you determine what’s best for you and your farm.
